# Axes & vectors of change

So another way to see a *responsibility* is as an axis of change.
Multiple such axes make up a space of change, and each new requirement coming from customer may be viewed as a vector in that space.

Vectors may be aligned with some axis, or point at some arbitrary direction. The more vector is aligned with an aixs, the more changes shall happen in that particular *responsibility*.
